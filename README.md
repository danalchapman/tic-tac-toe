Unsurprising to anyone who knows me, I enjoy getting to flex the creative side of my brain and I had a lot of fun playing with the CSS to design a thematic board. Even before our instructor was done sharing the specs for this project I knew I wanted to incorporate the sun and the moon as the "opposing" players, with some thought on future dropdown additions.
