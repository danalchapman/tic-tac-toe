Tic-Tac-Toe is the final project for Turing's Mod 1 Front-End Engineering students. With this last project we combine all of the lessons from the first five weeks to create a tangible and interactive web page to showcase the knowledge we've learned, as well as indulging the more creative sides of our minds.
If you're new to the world of Tic-Tac-Toe, do not fear -- you don't need fancy gadgets or gizmos a plenty. The rules for Tic-Tac-Toe are simple and ageless: you and another player (in this case, another friend or rival!) will choose a side, the Sun or the Moon. Your ultimate goal is to win the game by achieving a 3-token line either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Your page will display the winner or a draw, and then after a short period of time the board will reset so that you may face off once more. The side bar that corresponds with your chosen token will keep track of your wins, and all you need to play is an open broswer tab! (We recommend Chrome Web Broswer.)

Unsurprising to anyone who knows me, I enjoy getting to flex the creative side of my brain and I had a lot of fun playing with the CSS to design a thematic board. Even before our instructor was done sharing the specs for this project I knew I wanted to incorporate the sun and the moon as the "opposing" players, with some thought on future dropdown additions.
